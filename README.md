# Boids Simulation Project

## Overview
This project aims to implement a Boids (bird-oids) simulation using C++ and SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer).

## SDL usage
This project makes use of SDL which I inserted manually in my project files (not included in the repo) in "src" folder which contain the "include" and "lib" folders found at [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/download/release-2.30.11/SDL2-devel-2.30.11-mingw.zip), and the "SDL2.dll" file at the same level as the main.cpp at the root of the project.  
Mingw is also necessary and can be installed from [winlibs](https://winlibs.com/)
